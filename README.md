## History

In order to keep my team interested in phone call meetings back in the 2000
I created a Excel spreadsheet that would take a set of words and generates
a bingo card.  As time has gone by new features have been added.

## Why

Everyone needs their Hello World Application to learn a specific language.
I am using this repo to learn different approaches from languages to
cloud platforms.  Let me know if you would like to help.
