# Buzzword Bingo

Different way to create Bingo cards based on a set of words.

## History

In order to keep my team interested in phone call meetings back in the 2000
I created a Excel spreadsheet that would take a set of words and generates
a bingo card.  As time has gone by new features have been added. The
current version of the spreadsheet in the excel folder.
